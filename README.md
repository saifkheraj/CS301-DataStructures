# CS-301 Data Structures

My Course on Data Structures that I teach.

What you'll learn

    apply data structure concepts in different applications of computer science
    compare and contrast different data structure based on application
    write their own algorithms and can analyse between different algorithm
    implement various algorithms in programming language
    develop planning skills required for datastructure

Requirements

    Basics of programming
    Command over any programming language is preferred. (Java or C++)

Description

Data structure is an efficient way of organizing data and keeping the mess out of your system. This course teaches further about these data structures. The most popular data structures in store data category include binary search trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs. After learning the codes, you will be able to develop your knowledge side by side with your teacher. There are lot of other courses on data structures so why take this course?? (1. Teaching Style + Side by Side Coding with Theory 2. No use of traditional powerpoint slides)

This course was primarily made for those with basic knowledge of C++ that want to improve in computer science.

What is the working system of this course?

    Providing the illustration and examples for better understanding

    Easy lectures for beginners 

    Complete detailed explanation of data structures 

    Code in C++  

What does this course cover?

    Arrays

    Stacks

    Abstract data type

    Queues

    LinkedList

    Recursion

    Trees and other algorithms

    Hash Tables and Graphs (To be covered soon)

After completing the course, you will have enough knowledge to code these data structures on your own and be confident enough to perform your own data structural operations. Its purpose is to facilitate the introduction to programming and exercise the strategies. When designing or using a library, two things are fundamental: time efficiency operations with objects of classes and memory management. The C ++ is a language that tends to be very effective in these areas. This course is crucial in all these categories and will help you learn in the easiest possible way.

Knowing the basic techniques used during intermediate generation, optimization and code generation expanding programming techniques is the plot of computer science that you will always come back to.
